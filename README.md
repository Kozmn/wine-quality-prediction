# Wine Quality PredictionMachine learning pipeline for predicting red wine quality using UCI Wine Quality dataset.## OverviewImplements exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and ML models to predict wine quality scores (3-8 scale) based on physicochemical properties.## Dataset- UCI Wine Quality Dataset (Red Wine)- 1,599 samples, 11 features- Target: quality scores (3-8)- Features: alcohol, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, etc.## Project Structure```wine-quality-prediction/├── data/│   └── winequality-red.csv├── notebooks/│   └── 01_wine_quality_analysis.ipynb├── requirements.txt├── README.md└── PROJECT_SUMMARY.txt```## Installation```bashpip install -r requirements.txt```## UsageRun the Jupyter notebook:```bashjupyter notebook notebooks/01_wine_quality_analysis.ipynb```## Implementation Status### Completed- Exploratory data analysis- Feature correlation analysis- Data preprocessing pipeline (stratified split, standardization)- Linear Regression baseline model- Performance evaluation (MSE: 0.4064, MAE: 0.4951, R²: 0.3703)- Visualization suite (correlation heatmaps, distributions, box plots)### In Progress- XGBoost implementation- Model comparison analysis- Feature importance validation### Planned- Docker containerization- Flask API development- AWS deployment setup## Key Findings- Alcohol content: strongest positive predictor (+0.48 correlation)- Volatile acidity: strongest negative predictor (-0.39 correlation)- Class imbalance: 82% of wines have quality scores 5-6- Linear regression achieves R² = 0.37 with minimal overfitting## Dependencies- pandas- numpy- matplotlib- seaborn- scikit-learn- xgboost- jupyter## Repositoryhttps://github.com/Kozmn/wine-quality-prediction.git
